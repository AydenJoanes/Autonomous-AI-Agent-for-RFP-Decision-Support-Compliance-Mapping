    "justification": "Based on the compliance assessment results, I recommend a CONDITIONAL_BID for this RFP response. While our overall confidence score is low at 27 out of 100, we have met all mandatory requirements, which provides a foundation for moving forward. However, the significant number of unknown compliance areas necessitates that we address specific conditions before fully committing to the bid.\n\nOne of our key strengths lies in our ability to demonstrate compliance with all mandatory requirements, which reflects our commitment to meeting the client's essential needs. Additionally, we have three fully compliant areas and six partially compliant areas, indicating that we possess relevant experience and capabilities in certain aspects of the project. Our previous projects show a reasonable success rate, particularly in implementing scalable and auditable data ingestion and analytics systems, which aligns with the RFP's objectives.\n\nHowever, the assessment reveals critical gaps, particularly in the budget-related requirements, where we received an invalid budget rating with a confidence score of 0%. This indicates a significant risk in our ability to provide a clear and consistent cost structure, which is crucial for the client's decision-making process. Furthermore, the overall compliance level remains unknown for 13 of the evaluated requirements, raising concerns about our readiness to meet the client's expectations fully.\n\nTo proceed with a CONDITIONAL_BID, we must resolve the budget-related issues and clarify the unknown compliance areas. This may involve conducting further internal assessments or gathering additional documentation to substantiate our capabilities. By addressing these conditions, we can enhance our confidence level and strengthen our proposal.\n\nIn conclusion, while we have a solid foundation to build upon, it is essential to address the identified gaps before fully committing to this bid. I recommend that we initiate a focused effort to resolve the budget-related concerns and clarify the unknown compliance areas, allowing us to present a more robust proposal to the client.",
