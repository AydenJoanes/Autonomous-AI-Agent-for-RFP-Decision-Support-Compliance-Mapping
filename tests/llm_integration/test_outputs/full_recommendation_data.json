  "confidence_score": 61,
  "justification": "Based on the compliance assessment of the RFP, I recommend a CONDITIONAL_BID with a confidence level of 61 out of 100. This decision reflects a moderate fit with the requirements outlined in the RFP, acknowledging both our strengths and the areas that require further clarification or adjustment.\n\nOur key strengths include a valid ISO 27001 certification, which is crucial for demonstrating our commitment to information security, particularly in software development and cloud services. Additionally, our expert proficiency in AWS, backed by five years of experience, positions us well to meet the technical demands of the project. These factors contribute positively to our overall compliance and enhance our credibility as a potential partner.\n\nHowever, there are significant concerns that must be addressed before proceeding. The timeline requirement for project initiation in June 2026 presents a critical mismatch, as it exceeds our strategic maximum of 12 months. Furthermore, the budget requirement remains unknown due to an invalid status from the budget analyzer, which poses a risk to our ability to meet financial expectations. Additionally, while our AWS expertise is robust, the lack of documented Azure experience could be perceived as a gap, even though it is not a mandatory requirement.\n\nTo strengthen our bid, it is essential to resolve these issues. We must reassess our project scheduling and resource allocation to align with the June 2026 timeline. Additionally, conducting a thorough budget analysis will be necessary to ensure we can meet the estimated budget range of USD 100,000 to 125,000. \n\nIn conclusion, while we have a solid foundation to build upon, addressing these conditions is critical for a successful bid. I recommend initiating discussions with relevant stakeholders to clarify the timeline and budget requirements, thereby enhancing our proposal's competitiveness.",
  "executive_summary": "I recommend submitting a conditional bid, as we have met all mandatory requirements and achieved compliance with four out of six criteria. However, the primary concern is the timeline, which exceeds our strategic maximum by more than double, presenting a medium risk. Please review the timeline implications and decide on the next steps by the end of the week.",
