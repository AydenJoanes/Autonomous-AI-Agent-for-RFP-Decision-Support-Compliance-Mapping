2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
2.1 OFFICE OF HEALTH STRATEGY 
The Office of Health Strategy was established by the Connecticut General Assembly in 2018. The mission 
of the Office is to implement comprehensive, data driven strategies that promote equal access to high 
quality health care, control costs and ensure better health for the people of Connecticut. Under section 
19a-754a (and other sections of the general statutes), the Office is charged with, among other duties: 

6 
 
1) Developing and implementing a comprehensive and cohesive health care vision for the state, 
including, but not limited to, a coordinated state health care cost containment strategy. 
2) Promoting effective health planning and the provision of quality health care in the state in a manner 
that ensures availability of and improved access to cost-effective health care services for all state 
residents. 
3) Directing and overseeing the State Innovation Model Initiative and related successor initiatives. 
4) Coordinating the state's health information technology initiatives, administration of the all-payer 
claims database program, establishing and maintaining a consumer health information web site, 
designating a health information technology Officer; and 
5) Directing and overseeing the Health Systems Planning Unit. 
OHS develops health policy that improves health outcomes and limits health care cost growth across all 
sectors, whether private or public, including hospitals, physicians, clinical services, prescription drugs 
and medical devices and supplies. Creation of this Office brought together critical data sets and health 
information exchange efforts and allows for collaboration with many stakeholders, including state 
agency partners. Working with comprehensive data and experts from inside and outside government, 
OHS will develop and support state-led multi-payer health care reforms. 
Connecticut faces an urgent need to slow the growth in healthcare costs.  The historical growth rate in 
healthcare costs in the State is unsustainable; Connecticut is in the top tier of healthcare spending 
nationally.1  In 2014, Connecticut’s per capita spending on personal health care was $9,859 – the fifth 
highest in the nation, outpaced only by Vermont, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Alaska.  Over the last 
two decades, annual healthcare spending in Connecticut grew at more than twice the rate of growth in 
median household income (4.8 percent versus 2.0 percent).2  Consequently, healthcare has become 
unaffordable to many Connecticut residents and employers.  Since 2000, employer-sponsored insurance 
premiums in Connecticut have grown two and a half times faster than personal income.  This growth in 
premiums and in healthcare costs generally make it difficult for business to compete and thrive in 
Connecticut, which in turn leads to reduced worker wage growth. 
These effects of Connecticut’s high healthcare costs are felt by all Connecticut residents, but especially 
those with low and modest wages.  Connecticut has a higher household income distribution inequality 
than most other states, falling behind only Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and New York when 
measuring household income distribution inequality by looking at average income wages across the 
State.3  The economic effects of COVID-19 has heightened the strain of cost growth.  Connecticut ranks 
last among all states in terms of personal income growth during the pandemic.4  
A 2019 study by the Robert Graham Center found that Connecticut spends the least of any state in the 
United States on a per capita basis on primary care as a percentage of health care expenditures in one 
definition and is in the middle of the pack using a narrower or broader definition. A 2020 study by the 
New England States Consortium Systems Organization (NESCSO) also found that, using the narrow 
definition, Connecticut’s commercial payers’ primary care spending as a percentage of health care

expenditure is 5.3%, middle of the pack, and higher than Medicare Advantage’s (4.7%) and Medicare 
Fee-for-Service’s (2.8%), which were also the lowest in New England.5 The narrow definition excludes 
office-based and outpatient visits to obstetrics and gynecology, nurse practitioners, physician assistance 
and behavioral health services. 
Further, Connecticut continues to rate well in most national reports on health care, yet such reports 
continue to mask significant health disparities across the state. In particular, a 2020 Connecticut Health 
Foundation report found disparities such as: newborn black babies are four times more likely to die 
within a year of birth compared to their white peers; black residents are four times more likely to have a 
diabetes-related lower extremity amputation and twice more likely to die from diabetes as their white 
peers; black and Hispanic children and teens are five and one-half and four and one-half times, 
respectively, more likely than their white peers to visit the emergency department because of asthma; 
and black men are more likely than white men to die from prostate cancer. Additionally, a 2019 Kaiser 
Health News quality report indicates that all but one hospital in Connecticut were penalized by the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for thirty-day readmissions. Connecticut’s health care 
quality must improve across clinical quality measures and other measures of low-value care and patient 
safety.

2.2  HEALTH CARE BENCHMARK INITIATIVE 
A. EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 5  
 
To address rising healthcare costs the need to better resource primary care and the need to improve 
healthcare quality, on January 22, 2020 Governor Lamont signed Executive Order 5 to establish a 
statewide healthcare cost growth benchmark.  The Executive Order directs the Office of Health Strategy 
(OHS) to develop annual healthcare cost growth benchmarks for calendar years (CY) 2021-2025, and to 
implement several additional, related initiatives. 
1) The Executive Director of OHS, consistent with her statutory authority, shall monitor health care 
spending growth across all public and private payers and populations in Connecticut, report annually 
to the Governor on such growth, and, by December 2020, develop annual health care cost growth 
benchmarks.  
2) The Executive Director of OHS shall develop such initial annual benchmarks for calendar years 2021 
through 2025.  
3) The Executive Director, pursuant to her statutory authority under CGS Section 4-8, shall convene a 
Connecticut Cost Benchmark Technical Advisory Board to assist her in developing such benchmarks. 
The members of that Technical Advisory Board shall be named within the next thirty days and 
include the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and the Commissioners of the 
Department of Social Services and the Insurance Department, or their designees, and 
representatives of health care stakeholders.  
 
5 Connecticut’s Medicaid APCD data was not sufficiently complete for inclusion in the analysis.

4) Such health care cost benchmarks shall be based on total health care expenditures, defined as the 
per capita sum of all health care expenditures in this state from public and private sources for a 
given calendar year.  
5) Such health care cost growth benchmarks shall account for current primary care spending and set 
targets within each annual benchmark for increased primary care spending as a percentage of total 
health care expenditures to reach a target of 10% by calendar year 2025.  
6) To ensure the maintenance and improvement of healthcare quality, the Executive Director of OHS, 
with the input and assistance of the Commissioners of the Department of Social Services, the 
Department of Public Health, and the Insurance Department, shall use the existing OHS Quality 
Council to assist in the development of quality benchmarks across all public and private payers 
beginning in calendar year 2022. Such quality benchmarks may include clinical quality measures, 
under- and over-utilization measures, and patient safety measures.  
 
Benchmarks and primary care spending targets must account for the significant health care disparities in 
access and outcomes in Connecticut and should ensure that development of such benchmarks aims 
toward elimination in such disparities.  
 
The following paragraphs provide brief descriptions of the approach OHS will take to implement 
Executive Order 5.   
 
B. HEALTHCARE COST GROWTH BENCHMARK 
 
The healthcare cost growth benchmark is a targeted annual per capita maximum rate of spending 
growth that payers, providers, and the State are expected to adhere to.  The benchmark is based on a 
calculated and pre-determined weighted blend of the growth in the forecasted per capita potential 
gross state product (PGSP), and the forecasted growth in median income with a two-year add-on factor. 
The forecasted per capita PGSP for Connecticut is 3.7%. The forecasted median household income 
growth for 2026 – 2030 in Connecticut is 2.7%.  Table 1 below presents the Benchmark for 2021-2025.  
Performance against the benchmark will be reported at the State level, the market level, the payer level 
(including state payers), and provider organization level for provider organizations that have a sufficient 
number of attributable lives.

C. PRIMARY CARE SPENDING TARGET 
 
The primary care spending target aims to strengthen Connecticut’s primary healthcare services system 
by establishing a goal for increasing statewide primary care spending as a percentage of total health 
care expenditures; the target reaches 10 percent by Calendar Year 2025.  Research has demonstrated 
that greater relative investment in primary care leads to better patient outcomes, lower costs, and 
improved patient experience of care.6  Like most of the country, Connecticut’s healthcare system is 
largely specialist oriented.  This target is intended to rebalance and strengthen the State’s healthcare 
system by supporting improved primary care delivery. 
 
The primary care spending target for calendar year 2021 is 5.0 percent, using OHS’ definition of primary 
care spending. It is conservative given that the current best estimate of statewide spending on primary 
care is 4.8 percent. OHS calculated a statewide weighted average of current primary care spending by 
total medical expenditures utilizing commercial and Medicare data from UConn and Medicaid data from 
Freedman Healthcare, and the Department of Social Services. OHS’ advisory bodies recommended 
setting a conservative target for the first year of the Target due to the lack of payer-reported baseline 
data, utilization changes occurring due to COVID-19, and the proximity of the 2021 measurement period 
limiting payer actions to increase primary care spending in 2021.  
 
OHS will establish primary care spending targets for calendar years 2022-2024 in late 2021, after 
receiving guidance from its advisory bodies. Performance against the primary care target will be 
reported at the State, market, payer, and provider organization levels, in the same manner as the cost 
growth benchmark reporting. 
 
D. QUALITY BENCHMARKS 
 
OHS will develop quality benchmarks across all public and private payers beginning in 2022, including 
clinical quality measures, over/under utilization measures, and patient safety measures.  
 
OHS’ advisory body for the quality benchmarks, the CT Quality Council, is working to recommend a core 
measurement set for assessing primary care, specialty, and hospital provider performance and a 
common provider scorecard format for all payers and across the health ecosystem to align meaningful 
metrics and reduce the burden of repetitive or non-comparable analyses for the purposes of delivery 
and payment models that account for quality performance at the provider organization level.  
Subsequent to the updating of the core measure set, the Council will select a set of quality benchmarks 
that may include the core measures and population health measures that would be reported for the 
purposes of EO5 and applied similarly to the cost growth benchmark and primary care target, at the 
State, market, payer and provider organization levels.

E. DATA USE STRATEGY 
 
Governor Lamont’s Executive Order 5 calls upon OHS to monitor and report “annually on healthcare 
spending growth across public and private payers.”  OHS uses the term “data use strategy” to refer to its 
plan to purposefully leverage state and other publicly available data to achieve these objectives.  OHS 
will use the APCD and other publicly available data, including internal and external sources, to make sure 
the aims of the Executive Order and other policy objectives of the Office and the State are achieved.  By 
analyzing data, OHS can identify which spending categories warrant greatest attention for “moving the 
needle” on the cost growth benchmark.  The following types of analyses will be prioritized by OHS as 
part of its data use strategy consistent with the recommendations of its advisory bodies:  
1) analyses that identify the leading factors contributing to year-over-year health care cost growth 
(e.g., changes in utilization, price, service mix/intensity, patient demographics*);  
2) analyses that examine which cost drivers most contribute to total cost of care at a point in time 
(e.g., specific services, provider types, providers, medical conditions); and  
3) analyses of the effects of the cost growth benchmark, including any unintended consequences that 
may arise from its implementation.   
*OHS expects analyses to be stratified by race and ethnicity to address longstanding disparities.   Patient 
demographic categories may be expanded as data collection becomes more robust.

i It is straightforward to attribute spending an individual provider using billing or rendering national provider 
identifier (NPIs). However, many states do not have provider directories in place that map provider NPIs to 
specific practice sites and/or facilities. Creating and maintaining a provider directory requires si gnificant state 
commitment and effort.
